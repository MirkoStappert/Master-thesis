Topics that need to be explained:
\begin{itemize}
    \item spectra, constructions like 
    \item $\otimes$ of spectra, p-completeness (maybe also of ab. groups), fiber sequences
    \item Basics of infinity categories, (sym) monoidal structures, (co)limits
    \item Ring spectra ($\Eone$,\dots $\Einf$)
    \item Definition of $\THH$, maybe also shortly cyclotomic structure and definition of TC
\end{itemize}

Further things to cite:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Barnes-Roitzheim for p-completeness
    \item SAG: z-adic completeness.
    \item Nikolaus-Krause lecture notes
    \item Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy (functoriality of THH for number rings is open problem, page 148, beginning of chapter 4)
\end{itemize}
