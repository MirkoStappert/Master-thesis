\chapter*{Extended Abstract}

This thesis deals with certain computations of topological Hochschild homology.  \\
The included chapter contains an exposition of the work by Krause and Nikolaus which computes $\THH$ of complete mixed characteristic discrete valuation rings (\cite{KN}). This computation hinges on the choice of an uniformizer and is thus only functorial in maps that preserve uniformizers.
In future chapters we will thus try to identify the action of $\THH$ on arbitrary maps.
