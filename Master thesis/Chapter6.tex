\chapter{Functorial identifications of THH of CDVRs}
In this chapter, we will use the Tor-spectral sequence to understand the effect of THH on maps between complete discrete valuation rings.
See \cite[~Proposition 7.2.1.19]{lurie2017higher} for a statement of the Tor spectral sequence for modules spectra over a ring spectrum 
or ... \cite{stacks-project} for the more classical result in the case of chain complexes.

Let $R$ be a mixed characteristic complete discrete valuation ring with perfect residue field.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write $R$ as a pushout as follows $\Z_p[z]\otimes_{\Z_p[z]}\Z_p$ via Eisenstein polynomial (see footnote 5)
    \item $\THH$ preserves this pushout because the involved rings are commutative, and for $\Einf$-rings, $\THH$ is given by the colimit over $S^1$ in $\CAlg$.
    \item Fact that $\THH(\Z_p[z])\simeq \THH(\Z_p)\otimes_\Z \HH(\Z[z]/\Z)$ but not functorially, but have functoriality on homotopy groups
    $\THH*(\Z_p[z])\simeq \THH_*(\Z_p)\otimes_\Z \Omega_{\Z[z]/\Z)}$ functorialy!
    \item Noe employ Tor-spectral sequence.
\end{enumerate}
