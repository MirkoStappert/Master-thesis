\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis deals with the problem of the \textit{functorial} identification of topological Hochschild homology on certain rings. \\
The included chapter contains an exposition of the work by Krause and Nikolaus which computes $\THH$ of complete mixed characteristic discrete valuation rings (\cite{KNBokstedt}). This computation hinges on the choice of an uniformizer and is thus only functorial in maps that preserve the chosen uniformizers.
In future chapters we will thus try to identify the action of $\THH$ on arbitrary maps of these rings. 

%The proposed plan to do this, is to use the comparison map between topological Hochschild homology and ordinary Hochschild homology. The latter carries the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg filtration, which allows us to compute it using nonabelian derived functors of KÃ¤hler differentials.

%If time permits, we will also attempt to give a description of the functor $\THH$ on perfectoid rings. Here the identification on objects has been archieved by Bhatt, Morrow and Scholze in \cite[Chapter~6]{BMS2} but again under a certain choice of element.
