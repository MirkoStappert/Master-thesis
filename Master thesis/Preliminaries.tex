\chapter{Preliminaries}
Topics that need to be explained (or at least give reference):
\begin{itemize}
    \item spectra, 
    \item constructions like $\Sigma^\infty,\Omega^\infty$ 
    \item Eilenberg-Maclane spectra.
    \item (co)fiber sequences
    \item $\otimes$ of spectra uniquely determined by being closed symmetric monoidal with unit $\S$ and preserves colimits in each variable (separately)
    \item p-completeness (maybe also of ab. groups)
    \item Basics of infinity categories
    \item (sym) monoidal structures, 
    \item (co)limits
    \item adjunctions
    \item Ring spectra ($\Eone$,\dots $\Einf$)
    \item Postnikov towers?
    \item Definition of $\THH$, relative $\THH$ aswell as Hochschild homology
    \item maybe also shortly cyclotomic structure and definition of $\TC$
\end{itemize}

Further things to cite:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Barnes-Roitzheim for p-completeness
    \item SAG: z-adic completeness.
    \item Groth, Camarena and Gepner for quick intros to higher algebra and higher category theory.
    \item Nikolaus-Krause lecture notes 
    \item Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy (functoriality of THH for number rings is open problem, page 148, beginning of chapter 4)
\end{itemize}
\section{$\infty$-categories}
\section{Spectra}
\begin{defn}
    The $\infty$-category of spectra is defined as the following limit in the (very large) category $\Cat_\infty$
    \begin{equation*}
        \Sp\coloneqq \lim\left( \dots\xrightarrow{\Omega}\Spc_* \xrightarrow{\Omega} \Spc_* \xrightarrow{\Omega}\Spc_* \right)
    \end{equation*}
\end{defn}
Objects of this category are thus \todo{...}\\
By definition of this limit we have a functor $\Sp\rightarrow \Spc_*$, which we call $\Omega^\infty$.
Using the adjoint functor theorem \cite[5.5.2.9]{lurie2017higher} we obtain a right adjoint 
$\Sigma^\infty: \Spc_*\rightarrow \Sp$. Composing with the free-forgetful adjunction $\Spc_* \leftrightharpoons \Spc$
we obtain a further adjunction $\Sp\xleftrightharpoons[\Omega^\infty]{\sip}\Spc$.
