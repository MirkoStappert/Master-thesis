\chapter{Introduction}

The algebraic K-theory groups are fundamental invariants of rings. 
They encapsulate deep knowledge about the ring via its category of modules.
For rings of integers in number fields, the K-theory groups contain information about the class group and group of units of the ring, the Brauer group of the field and values of its Dedekind zeta function.
Algebraic K-theory can also be applied to schemes. In fact, it was first defined in this context by Grothendieck during the work on his Riemann-Roch theorem, where he discovered a remarkable relationship to algebraic cycles.
Later, Bloch pushed this relationship further to his newly defined higher Chow groups.
But maybe its most spectacular applications have been found in geometric topology.
Starting with the early work of Wall and the s-cobordism theorem by Barden-Mazur-Stalling it culminated in the incredible stable parametrized h-cobordism theorem by Waldhausen, Jahren and Rognes. It says, that the stable h-cobordism space of say a smooth manifold $M$ can be obtained from the K-theory space of $\S[\Omega M]$, the spherical group ring of the loop space of $M$.
This is remarkable, because this allows us - as does the classical h-cobordism theorem - to obtain geometric results for $M$ purely using homotopy theory.
One of its implications is that we can calculate many homotopy groups of the diffeomorphism group of $M$ via the K-theory groups of $\S[\Omega M]$.
For example the homotopy groups of the diffeomorphism group of a disc $\pi_* (\operatorname{Diff}(D^n))$ can (in a range depending on $n$) be obtained by computing the K-theory groups of the sphere spectrum. This boils down to the understanding of $K_*(\Z)$ about which we know a lot by several major results in number theory.
\\
These powerful results and theorems now present us with the challenge to actually compute K-theory groups. 
This problem is in general very hard! 
There are therefore several successful approaches towards these computations, which nicely complement each other. Among them are motivic methods, controlled algebra and trace methods. 
Let us only describe the last one, as it is the one of relevance for this thesis.
The idea of trace methods is to consider other - ideally more computable - spectrum valued invariants of rings and compare K-theory to them via so-called trace maps. 
The hope is that while these invariants are more computable, the difference to K-theory is not too big, in other words the trace map is close to an isomorphism. 
The most successful of these comparisons is with the trace map $K\xrightarrow{\tr} \TC$ to the so-called \textit{topological cyclic homology} introduced by Bökstedt-Hsiang-Madsen.
By work of Dundas-Goodwillie-McCarthy and Hesselholt-Madsen, we now know that the trace map is a remarkably close approximation that has been used to calculate K-theory in many cases.
Due to the recent work of Nikolaus-Scholze, topological cyclic homology itself can essentially be computed via two spectral sequences out of yet another invariant: Topological Hochschild homology ($\THH$).
This is the main player of this thesis and the goal is to provide a new computation of $\THH$, that has not been done before. \\
The rings, that we will consider are complete discrete valuation rings of mixed characteristic. 
To be concrete, all of them are certain extensions of the $p$-adic integers, like $\Z_p[\sqrt[n]{p}]$ or $\Z_p[\zeta_{p^n}]$. They arise for example as completions of rings of integers in number fields and are thus of fundamental importance in algebraic number theory.
The topological Hochschild homology of these rings has already been computed in the work of Lindenstrauss-Madsen. 
Recently Krause and Nikolaus gave a more conceptual proof of the same result, which we present in the first chapter of this thesis. 
Unfortunately, both approaches do not give a functorial computation. They only identify $\THH$ of these rings but do not answer the question what it does to morphisms. 
This is unsatisfactory for at least two reasons: We might want to understand the action of the Galois group on K-theory. Because the trace map $K\xrightarrow{\tr}\TC$ is a natural transformation and $\TC$ is functorially obtained from $\THH$, the first step to understand the functoriality of K-theory is to understand it for $\THH$.
Secondly, functorial descriptions are often needed for further computations. For example, in our computation, we crucially need that we not only know the topological Hochschild homology groups of $\Z_p[z]$ but \textit{also}  
how endomorphisms of $\Z_p[z]$ act on the topological Hochschild homology groups of it. \\
Let us now give a short outline of our approach to understand the functoriality of $\THH_*(R)$ (more precisely we deal with the $p$-completions of these groups).
Firstly we use, that by a general classification result all mixed characteristic discrete valuation rings are obtained from $\Z_p$ by adjoining a root of an Eisenstein polynomial, i.e. $R=\Z_p[z]/E(z)$ for $E(z)\in \Z_p[z]$ Eisenstein\footnote{Actually we need to take the Witt vectors of the residue field of $R$, but for sake of exposition we stick to the easiest case that the residue field is $\F_p$ and the Witt vectors are $W(\F_p)=\Z_p$}.
This allows us to write $R$ as follows $R=\Z_p[z]\otimes_{\Z_p[z]}\Z_p$, where $\Z_p[z]$ acts on the left factor by the map $z\mapsto E(z)$ and on the right factor by $z\mapsto 0$. 
Now we can observe, that $\THH$ preserves tensor products of commutative rings, i.e. we get $\THH(R)=\THH(\Z_p[z])\otimes_{\THH(\Z_p[z])}\THH(\Z_p)$. This is progress because we know what $\THH(\Z_p)$ is. Furthermore, by a Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg type result we also obtain $\THH(\Z_p[z])\simeq\THH(\Z_p)\otimes_{\Z_p}\HH(\Z[z]/\Z)$. This is not a natural equivalence on the level of spectra, but it is natural after taking homotopy groups $\THH_*(\Z_p[z])\simeq\THH_*(\Z_p)\otimes_{\Z}\Omega^*_{\Z[z]/\Z}$. We exactly know how Kähler differentials are functorial, thus we completely understand the functoriality on the level of homotopy groups. Now we want to go from these homotopy groups to $\THH_*(R)$ and for this we can employ the Tor-spectral sequence to the tensor product formula, we found above: $\THH(R)=\THH(\Z_p[z])\otimes_{\THH(\Z_p[z])}\THH(\Z_p)$. This spectral sequences has $E^2$-page given by graded Tor-groups and converges to $\THH_*(R)$. A map $R\to S$ induces a map between the respective spectral sequences. Therefore we need to understand the differentials and extension behaviour. This is in fact possible, because we know by the result of the first chapter, what $\THH(R)$ is and thus the target of the spectral sequence. In the last chapter we will then precisely analyze the spectral sequence, identify all differentials and extension problems and therefore give a full description of the functoriality of $\THH_*$ for all rings under consideration.
