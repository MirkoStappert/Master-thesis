\chapter{Functorial identifications of THH of CDVRs}
In this chapter, we will use the Tor-spectral sequence to understand the effect of THH on maps between complete discrete valuation rings.
See \cite[~Proposition 7.2.1.19]{lurie2017higher} for a statement of the Tor spectral sequence for modules spectra over a ring spectrum 
or \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/061Y}{Tag 061Y}]{stacks-project} for the more classical result in the case of chain complexes.

Let $R$ be a mixed characteristic complete discrete valuation ring with perfect residue field.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write $R$ as a pushout $R\cong\Z_p[z]\otimes_{\Z_p[z]}\Z_p$ via Eisenstein polynomial (see footnote 5)
    \item $\THH$ preserves this pushout because the involved rings are commutative, and for $\Einf$-rings, $\THH$ is given by the colimit over $S^1$ in $\CAlg$ which means that it commutes with arbitrary colimits.
    \item Fact that $\THH(\Z_p[z])\simeq \THH(\Z_p)\otimes_\Z \HH(\Z[z]/\Z)$ but not functorially, but have functoriality on homotopy groups
    $\THH*(\Z_p[z])\simeq \THH_*(\Z_p)\otimes_\Z \Omega_{\Z[z]/\Z)}$ functorialy!
    \item Now employ Tor-spectral sequence:\\
     $E^2_{i,j}=\Tor_{\pi_*(R)}^i\left( \pi_*(M), \pi_*(M)\right)_{(j)}\Rightarrow \pi_{i+j}\left( M\otimes_R N \right)$
    , i.e. in our case: 
    \\
    $\Tor_{\THH_*(\Z_p[z])}^i\left( \THH_*(\Z_p[z]),\THH_*(\Z_p)\right)_{(j)}\Rightarrow \THH_{i+j}(R)$ (or rather the $p$-completed version)

\end{enumerate}
